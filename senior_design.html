<!--Notes:  projects each have their own page in projects folder
                alternitevely take list off of front page and put it in another page, deletes need for each project to have own page
                    length of project description and other info is long, then do separate pages for each 
            maybe switch stuff around and put stuff in pages, see after feedback from first iteration

                                    <p>
                                        Investment analysis at Principal Gloabl Investors currently relies on human calculation,
                                        using a variety of models and inputs. These statistical models are proven and effective,
                                        although the dependence upon human-given inputs and calculations is both inefficient
                                        and unreliable. Various steps of the statistical analysis process can be automated through
                                        software. This would remove most of the potential for human error, expedite the decision
                                        making process, and reduce overhead costs by making accurate statistical modeling and
                                        prediction more accessible. Our proposed solution makes use of our background in computational sciences to
                                        implement a software approach to multi-factor statistical analysis. We aim to create a
                                        system which aids in the creation and management of an investment portfolio based upon
                                        well-defined statistical models and machine learning algorithms, which consistently
                                        outperforms the market. Such a system would not only increase profits for portfolio
                                        owners, but it would also reduce risk by eliminating erroneous human action and
                                        increasing decision-making speed in a volatile stock market.

                                    <h4 class="title">Individual Contribution</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I have contributed to this project in three different avenues. The first is a position I hold on the team officially. 
                                        That is the communications lead. I am responsible for isntigating and maintaining contact with various parties that are
                                        a part of our project. In our case, it is only our client, which consists of a group of people within Principal Global Investors.
                                        I also communicate with our faculty advisor. I schedule meetings and talking points for those meetings. I also am responsible 
                                        for conveying concerns and questions from the team to the applicable people.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another way I contribute is through a utility we use to work with the data we use more efficiently. We had the idea to have a library that 
                                        supports our data so the team can use the data more efficiently and with ease. I was tasked with this part of our project. I built it, 
                                        I maintain it, and I update it. Updates happen, when there is a bug in the code, or there are features that the team wants in the library.
                                        I do lot of work on this to make sure that people can use the data easily and can focus on testing and finding the best models.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                       The last way I contribute to the team, individually, is with the actual project part. In machine learning, there are multiple different models
                                       that people havce access to. They can all be used to predict classifications based on the inputs. Since there are many, the decision the team made
                                       was to divide up models between everyone. Each member took a model, learned about it, and experimented with it. There is one specific model, 
                                       the Naive Bayes, that I was tasked with working with. I work with the data, doing tests on the model with the data as input and report the findings 
                                       of these tests to our client.
                                    </p>

                                    <h4 class="title">What I've Learned</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        I have learned a lot about statistics and machine learning in my time so far on this project. I've also learned what it means to work with a team more.
                                        Working with people on tasks and suppoirting people on their goal to complete a task is something new that I've experienced this year. 
                                        I also have experienced The pressure of being relied upon for both information and contributions helped me learn how to focus and dillegently work 
                                        for the sake of the team.
